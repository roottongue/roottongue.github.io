##### After 5 years of activity, the ROOT TONGUE web application artifacts were migrated to GitHub in 2022. On this site you will see the artifacts of the original working prototype. The site also provides the building blocks for the Root Tongue mobile and web app project currently underway with the continued aim to contribute provocative and forward steps toward the planetary path of supporting language diversity. In the meantime, thank you to the ROOT TONGUE team and everyone who supporters and participants! You can take a tour of ROOT TONGUE with the following demo.

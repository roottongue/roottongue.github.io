### When engaging with Root Tongue, the onboarding process describes what participation entails with four scrolling frames:

1. Watch. View thematic videos (1â€“4 minutes in length)
2. Contemplate. After each video plays you will be asked a question
3. Respond. Submit stories in text, image, audio or video
4. Connect. Visit the community gallery to see other responses

#### The thematic video clips can also be accessed in the drop-down menu.

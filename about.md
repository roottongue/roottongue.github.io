# About

Among the 6,000 or so languages in the world, an average of 2 languages disappear each month. Because linguicide is generally a slow death, and sometimes not apparent until the last speaker is remaining, the dialogue and actions around language endangerment must be ongoing.


ROOT TONGUE engages audiences motivated by the stories and issues raised in the film TONGUES OF HEAVEN, co-directed by Anita Chang, An-Chi Chen, Kainoa Kaupu, Hau'oli Waiau and Shin-Lan Yu. In the documentary, four young indigenous women from Taiwan and Hawai'i use video cameras to share their challenges in learning the languages of their forebears before they go extinct. They ask themselves and their community: What do you lose when you lose your native language?


In this ROOT TONGUE app, clips from the documentary and companion questions allow you to explore the challenges of language endangerment and preservation by sharing your own perspective through dialogue and creative uploads of your videos, images, audio and writings. You can also access educational and community resources pertaining to language preservation. We welcome your suggestions for language preservation and learning resources.


We hope you will join us in sharing your challenges, promises and successes, and that you will find meaningful connections here.

Her first language was Taiwanese or Minnanese, but she gradually lost her ability to speak it when she started learning English in the U.S., a common phenomenon for second-generation children of immigrants to the U.S. Anita’s award-winning works have screened and broadcast internationally, and been presented at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Walker Arts Center, Museum of Fine Arts Houston, and National Museum of Women.

## Project Director Statement by Anita Chang

It wasn’t until I started living and working in Taiwan that I learned of the incredible diversity of languages spoken on the island. During the first two years while I was teaching film in the Department of Indigenous Languages and Communications at National Dong Hwa University located in eastern Taiwan, I was made aware of an on-going lament by my students in their limited or lack of ability to speak their mother tongue, their linguistic heritage being from one or more of the 16 distinct indigenous languages, Minnanese and/or Hakka. Keenly aware that they and their peers are not speaking their heritage languages, they foresaw a bleak future for the survival of these languages. This is how the idea of the film came about, and a production method that involved young co-directors to collaboratively tackle this issue of language endangerment arising out of Taiwan’s complex colonial history. The production inevitably evolved a compelling exchange with young indigenous peoples from Hawai'i, known worldwide for its language revitalization efforts.
